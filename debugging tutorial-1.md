# Debuggging Tutorial for Project "Advanced Irrigation System"
Check out this link for complete project description:
[ Advanced Irrigation System ](https://github.com/kapilgarg7568/Electronics-Club-Mini-Task-2/blob/master/Advanced%20Irrigation%20System.md)
 
Pipeline for Project:
`Temp.,Humidity and Soil Moisture sensor`=>Input for `Microcontroller`(Analyse the input signal)=>give command to `Relay`=>`Water Pump` 
=>`Irrigation to plants.`

dispaly the data recieved from differnt sensors <=`Microcontroller`=>Send Updates and Recieve messages

so if your project is not working problem must be in the any one element of the above pipeline

but before going into the pipeline check some basic things which will help you debigging your circuit
- check if all modules light up and getting right power supply just by checking voltage at different points and the modules which doesnt glow have bben shorted and we need to purchase a new one.
- check whether any devices is getting heated up and if ans is yes then its bad news, you might have burnt it check out resource section to buy a new one.
